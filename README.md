#The Who

######This project was to create a front-end website for a band in the 1960s. I have choosen to recreate The Who's website. I wanted to make the
website look as modern as possible so i decided to use some bright colour through out the website. I have created several pages that show a
lot of content about The Who. Initially i was not going to create a merchandise page but half way through creating this project i felt like
it was ideal for the website. I have used similar colours to the bands original colour scheme. However i have used quite a calm background
throughout so the content stands out. I have a few pages you can navigate through using the nav bar, that includes of th home, about, gallery,
merchandise and tickets pages. I have also used bootstrap social icon buttons on my nav bar to link to their offical sites. I wanted to focus
on the theme on the website and implement lots of images and videos to influence my audience. It took me a long time to get the website responsive
and for the content to be placed in the right position on the page. I have tried to add as many different features that can show off the code and
the website itself.

#UX

######For this project i wanted to cater for both young and older adults. The website needed to be simple so everyone could navigate around it but
also interesting so the audience carries on looking through the site. I started working on the home page first to get the overal theme of the
website created. I knew i wanted a big image covering the top part of the home page which i decided to use again in the abouts page. Initially
a bands website is for users to 'check out tour dates', 'keep up-to-date with the latest music', 'buy band merchandise', 'read about a band member',
'watch videos of their favorite band' and lots more, so i wanted to make sure i had enough content for everyone. I decided i needed links to relevent
websites to keep in with social media, so i made it easy to find with a direct link on the nav bar and social wall. I think i have managed to create
a website that will be helpful to most users and allow them to perform an action to achieve a goal.

#Features

######For my homepage i decided to add a row of album covers to show the audience the bands history.
I have used a carousel to show off the social media sites.
I have used Youtube videos to allow the user to interact and watch things.
I decided to use a fixed nav bar throughout the website so it is simple and you can navigate around easily.
I used a marquee under the top image on the home page to advertise to the audience that the band now perform at special occasions.
For my dates page i decided to use a table to show all the tour dates, this way eveyrthing is order and easy to understand.
I have used buttons such as 'buy' and linked them directly to the selling site so it is easy for users to navigate from my site to others.
I have also used effects on my buttons such as the hover effect on the nav bar to give the website a bit of extra features.
Throughout the site there is several images and videos of the band that have been used from the internet.
