        <h2>John Entwistle</h2>
        <p>
          John Entwistle, The Who's original bass player, was born in Chiswick in west London on the 9th October 1944.<br> Drawn to rock'n'roll, he became a fan of Duane Eddy, the US guitarist whose hit singles featured a twangy guitar playd in a low
          register, and soon abandonded his trumpet for a home-made bass guitar, playing in school groups The Confederates and The Scorpians with his friend Pete Townshend. In 1961, he was approached to join fellow Acton County Grammar school pupil Roger
          Daltrey's group to let Townshend join, and n 1964 they became The Who.<br> John contribtd to The Who's distinctive sound by cultivating a lead style of bass, underpinning Pete's more ryhthmic style of guitar payng with inventive runs in a higher
          register than most bass players, while at the ssame time keeping the group's timing rigid during Keith Moon's voltile thrashings.<br> The Who's third single, 'My Generation' feautred a prominent bass solo by Entwistle, the first of its kind
          on a rock record, but unlike his colleagues John remained virtually motionless on stage, quietly observing - and underpinning - the reckless styles of Pete emerged as The Who's songwriter-in-chief, John began making distinctive, macabre contributions
          to The Who's catalogue.<br> John's impressive musicanship continued apace and his work on 'The Real Me' from Quadrophenia and 'Dreaming From The Waist' (from 1975's The Who By Numbers) was particularly memorable. In the meantime, John sought
          an outlet for his backlog of songs. John also compiled a Who leftovers collection Odds & Sods in 1974 and with The Who resting in 1975, went out on the road with his own band, Ox. He also fronted the John Entwistle Band on US club tours during
          the 1990s, and appeared with former Beatle Ringo Starr's All Starr Band, in 1995. A talented artist, John held exhbitions of his paintings, many of them featuring The Who, on a regular basis, and his drawing of The Who graces the sleeve of The
          who by numbers.<br>By the end of the millennium, a stripped down version of The Who - consisting of Pete, Roger, John, keyboard player John 'Rabbit' Bundrick, and Ringo Starr's son, Zak Starkey were touring again, amply demonstrating to original
          fans and a new generation of musicians just how they had established their original credentials. On these later tours John would perform his extraordinary bass solo on '5.15', footage of which was incorporated into Who concerts after his death.<br>          John died from a heart attack on 27th June 2002, in Las Vegas on the eve of an American Who tour which carried on with a hastly-recruited Pino Palldino playing bass.</p>

        <h2>Roger Daltrey</h2>

        <p>
          Roger Daltrey was born in the West London suburb of Shepherd's Bush on 1st March 1944. Roger first assembled the group that would become The Who in 1961 while at Acton County School, recruiting John Entwistle and subsequently agreeing to John's proposal
          that Pete Townshend should join.
          <br> Roger's earliest tastes in music ran to the blues and R&B which formed the setlist during their early years as The Detours, as well as Fiffties rock'n'roll. In surrendering his leadership of the band to Pete when the latter became the group's
          songwriter, Roger became the mouthpiece for Pete's lyrics and ideas. At the same time he contributed to the group's sense of showmanship by developing his unique skill at twirling his micrphone lead around like a lasso and, by the time of Tommy
          in 1969, becoming one of rock's most iconic sex symbols with his golden curls, bare chest and fringed suede jackets.<br>In many respects the experience of singing Tommy song-cycle enabled Roger to become Tommy Walker, the deaf dumb and blind
          boy of Pete's imagination, and it was therfore only natural that he should assume the role in Ken Russel's movie adaption of the rock opera in 1975, for which he recieved a Golden Globe nomination.
          <br> Roger has cultivated a singing career outside of The Who, beinning in 1973 when he found himself on the BBC's Top of the Pops, the UK's then premier chart TV show, promoting the single 'Giving It All Away' which reached number five in the
          UK charts It was a track from his first solo album Daltrey, released tht same year, which he followed up with the albums that include Ride A Rock Horse (1975), One Of The Boys (1977), the soundtrack to McVicar (1980), Parting Should Be Painless
          (1984) and Ater The Fire (1985).
          <br> Roger has appeared on stage away from The Who on many occasions, and his 1994 solo concert at New York's Carnegie Hall, with the Julliard Ochestra. Since 2000 he has been a patron of the Teenage Cancer Trust, a charity that builds specialised
          wards for teenagers with cancer in the UK. That year Roger had the idea of setting up the first show at the Royal Albert Hall by 'The Who & Friends', with ticket sales and revenue from a DVD and CD raising over £1.2 million, and as a result
          Roger was given a Humanitrian Award in 2003 from Time magazine. The Teen Cancer Trust shows during April have now become an established and eagerly awaited annual event at the Albert Hall. In February 2005, Roger was awarded a CBE by the Queen
          at Buckingham Palace for his services to music and good causes.<br>Ever pursuing his mission to give something back to teenagers, 'without whom' he said, 'we would have no career'. In November 2010, Roger, with Pete Townshend at his side, launched
          Teen Cancer America. A year later, on March 24, Roger and his band gave a complete perormance of Tommy at a Teenage Cancer Trust show at the Royal Albert Hall, supported by imagery which he commissioned from students of Middlesex University.
          Over the next year, he toured Tommy in the US, Europe and Japan.<br>Between November 2012 and March 2013, The Who toured an arenca production of Quadrophenia & More in the US and UK with added shows in Paris and Amsterdam. Roger now divides
          his time between working with The Who and his solo band as well as continuing to devote a huge amount of time to Teenage Cancer Trust and Teen Cancer America.</p>

        <h2>Pete Townshend</h2>
        <p>Pete Townshend, The Who's guitarist and principal songwriter, was born in Chiswick west London on 19th May 1945.<br>Having dallied briefly with the guitar, Pete's first real instrument was the banjo which he played in a schoolboy trad tazz outfit
          called The Confederates. Pete and John both attended Acton County School where another, slightly older pupil Roger Daltrey had a group called The Detours.<br>Meanwhile Pete had graduated to Ealing School of Art, where he broadened his mind to
          radical performance art and Americian blues music, both of which would eventually inform The Detours as they worked their passage through the west London club and pub circuit. With the arrival in 1964 o drummer Keith Moon and managers Kit Lambert
          and Chris Stamp, The Who were on their way to success.<br> As guitarist and composer of the band, he became the driving force behind one of the most powerful, inventive and articulate bodies of work in rock. Pete spent all of the Sixties and
          much of the Seventies concentrating on The Who. In concert he became recognised as the most visual guitarist of his and future generations, careering around the stage, leaping into the air and spinning his arm across the strings in his trademark
          'windmill' fashion. He developed a unique guitar style, a crss between rhythm and lead which veered from furiouslt strummed chord patterns and crunching power chords to chromatic scales and delicate finger-picking. On top of this he frequently
          smashed his guitar into smithereens at the climax of performance.<br> Pete has run his own book publishing company and worked as an editor at the literary publishing house Faber & Faber which in 1985 published 'Horse's Neck', a collection of
          his short stories. In 1970, the technology wasn't avaliable for the project to be realised and it took Pete almost 30 years to see it through.<br> A 'Lifehouse Method' website was made avaliable from 2007 to 2008 through which 'sitters' were
          able to create musical portaits online. Pete continued to write and perform with The Who and 2006 saw the release of 'Endless Wire', the band's first new album in 24 years. In 2012 Harper-Collins published Pete's long awaited autobiography 'Who
          I Am', a typically fortright memoir of his life inside and outside of The Who.<br> This current decade has seen The Who tour in 2006 and 2007 and again n 2011 and 2012 with Quadrophenia & More. In 2014 The Who celebrated their 50 years together
          by embarking on a two year teour nd a greatest hits album and worldwid tour both being an enormous success which culminated in two spectacular weekend concerts as part of the Desert Trip event at Coachella, California. In 2017 you see The Who
          returning to the Royal Albert Hall, London to perform 'Tommy' for the 100th concert in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust.
          <br> In 2016 Pete signed to Universal Music for his solo work which saw the re-release of the first seven solo albums from his back catalogue including 1972's 'Who Came First' right through to 1993's 'Psychoderelict'. All albums were realesed
          on both CD and heavyweight vinyl. Future reissues will incude his 'Scoop' series of albums.</p>

        <h2>Keith Moon</h2>
        <p>
          Keith Moon was born in Wembley on 23rd August 1946. Brashly confident, he played quite differently to his peers, turning his massive kit into a lead instrument, and his up-front technique was cruicil in estabishing The Who's passionate style. He became
          a surf music fan as a schoolboy, took early lessons on drums as a teenager and played with three local bands in his native Wembley in north west London, the Escorts, Mark Twain and The Stangers, and The Beachcombers, before joining The Who in
          the spring of 1964 after an impromptu audition at the Oldfield pub in Greenford.
          <br> Moon announced his arrival in spectacular fashion on The Who's first real single 'I Can't Explain' (1965) on which his rifleshot snare pre-emptied Roger Daltrey's leap into the chorus. Mostly, though, his foil was Pete Townshend with whom
          he developed an uncanny musical relationship, the product of which became one of The Who's greatest trademarks the chiming, bell-like, open-stringed power chord, cross cut against pounding drums and bass and allowed feedback on itself and drone
          into a wall of electronic discord.<br> On Townshend's celebrated rock opera he becomes orchestra within himself, driving the band along with the intelligence and sureness of touch that defines analysis. On 'Who's Next' (1971) Moon is reined
          in somewhat but his playing on the bridge on 'Behind Blue Eyes' and throughout bout 'Bargain' and 'Won't Get Fooled Again' ranks with anything he ever did.
          <br>Moon's kit was the biggest in rock, at one stage boasting at least 10 tom-toms, twin bass drums, twin timpani, snare, half-a-dozen cymbols and a gong. With this vast array of percussion at his command, he adopted a peculiar style wherein
          he pointed his sticks downwards and as John Entwistle once remarked: 'He didn'y play from left to right or right to left, he'd play forwards. I've never seen anyone play like that before or since.
          <br>At the same time Keith was rock's most wildest character in the Sixties and Seventies, an unapologetic freewheeling hedonist whose lifestyle became synonymous with the mad, carefree image of the rock star at large. As The Who became massively
          popular worldwide, so Keith Moon became a celebrity, not just as a drummer, but as the mad jester to rock's high court whose exploits incuded cross-dressing, elaborate practical jokes and at much-publicised eposide when he and his great friend
          Vivian Stanshall of the Bonzo Dog Band vistited a London beerkeller dressed in Nazi SS uniforms. Keith's Chertsey home, Tara House, became the venue for many memorable parties, not least the 1971 launch of 'Who's Next'.<br>When The Who slowed
          down and Pete Townshend sought creative outlets elsewhere Keith moved to California and took cameo roles in several movies, most notably in 'That'll Be The Day' (1973) and its sequel 'Stardust' (1974), as the drummer in a fictitous rock band
          led by David Essex. He also completed a solo album, 'Two Sides of the Moon' (1975) before moving back to the UK in 1977 to play on 'Who Are You', his last recorded work with The Who.<br>Keith died in London on the 7th Septemeber 1978, from an
          accidental overdose of the prescrpiption drug Heminevrin, prescribed to combat alcholism.</p>
